["Spotlight on Optics"](https://www.osapublishing.org/spotlight/about.cfm) features articles nominated by the OSAÂ´s Topical and Associate Editors to show the breadth and quality of OSA content. Journal Editors identify articles for Spotlight that generally appeal to the broader optics and photonics community. Spotlight articles have excellent scientific quality, are representative of the level of work taking place in a specific area, and put other work in perspective.

Once a paper is confirmed as selected, Panel members consisting of specialists from the scientific community, then review the research and compose the article's accompanying Spotlight summary, which is written in a layman style.

I have already collaborated with Spotlight in the past and I am now looking forward to continue serving its purpose from my new role! ðŸ™Œ
