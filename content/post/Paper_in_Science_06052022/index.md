## Fibre-based quantum frequency conversion

We reported a breakthrough in quantum-correlation-preserving frequency conversion using hydrogen-filled anti-resonant fibres. A spatio-temporal pattern of synchronized molecular vibrations is first created in the gas by stimulated Raman scattering. Within its lifetime, such molecular choreography is then used for highly efficient, correlation-preserving frequency conversion of single photons.

The approach elegantly combines quantum photonics, gas-based nonlinear optics, specialty hollow-core fibres, and molecular physics to realize an efficient tool that can operate in any spectral band from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared -- an ultra-broad working range inaccessible to existing technologies. The findings may be used to develop fibre-based tools in technologies such as quantum communications, and quantum-enhanced imaging.
