We have secured funding for the next 3 years to conceive and develop a new generation of small-footprint fibre-based sources of ultraviolet light. The project also includes a fully-funded 4-year PhD position. We will hold the kick-off meeting in September, right after the summer break. CanÂ´t wait to start!
