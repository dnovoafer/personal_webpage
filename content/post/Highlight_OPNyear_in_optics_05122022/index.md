## Fibre-based quantum frequency conversion selected as one of the breakthroughs in optics in 2022

The outreach magazine ["Optics & Photonics News"](https://www.optica-opn.org/home/articles/volume_33/december_2022/extras/tunable_frequency_conversion_of_single_photons_in/) has selected our recent work on quantum frequency conversion using anti-resonant fibres as one of the 30 highlights of the year in optics. Very honored to be recognized in that list along with so many ground-breaking results. LetÂ´s keep moving! ðŸ™Œ
