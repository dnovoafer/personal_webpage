The ever-growing capabilities of modern computers, along with the development of more sophisticated algorithms, have facilitated an explosion of the use of modern machine learning approaches to solve problems of relevance in Physics and Engineering. Interestingly, artificial intelligence-based solutions can find nonintuitive solutions to long-standing issues, even when the amount of information available about the relevant systems is small.

We are interested in using advanced machine learning approaches such as deep learning using artificial neural networks to optimize nonlinear, extreme optical processes ocurring inside confined environments. In particular, while supervised learning models may open a new era of *smart* fibre-based devices capable of self-adapting themselves to keep optimum operation under given conditions, unsupervised learning might facilitate the discovery of rather exotic, but viable photonic designs with unique optical properties.
