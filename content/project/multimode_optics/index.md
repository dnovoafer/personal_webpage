There has recently been a renewed interest in the study and exploitation of the spatial degree of freedom in confined waveguide geometries. For this purpose, broadband-guiding hollow-core fibres are excellent platforms since they are inherently multimode structures where every transverse mode features distinct spatial profile and dispersion. The latter knob can be thereby tuned to allow for phase-matched, efficient nonlinear conversion of intense laser light travelling through the central hollow channel of the fibre.

We try to exploit this capability of hollow waveguides to design novel strategies for frequency conversion of light in fully collinear geometries, where the inherent phase-velocity mismatch can be compensated using different fibre modes. Along the same lines, we are also interested in the manipulation of quantum light sources such as biphotons, whose delicate quantum correlations can be tailored and preserved over long distances under the right conditions.
