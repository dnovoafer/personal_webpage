I am an Ikerbasque Research Fellow and visiting professor at the University of the Basque Country (EHU/UPV). My main research interests are focused in the development of novel light sources and sensors based on micro/nano-structured fibre technology.

This is yet to be properly filled up! But I am back in business! Ohh sure I am! And will now crash it! You´ll see!
