abstract: We report a fully integrated interface delivering efficient, reflection-free, single-mode, and self-aligned coupling between a step-index fiber and a gas-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The device offers a universal solution for interfacing solid and hollow cores and can be sealed to allow operation either evacuated or at high pressure. Stimulated Raman scattering and molecular modulation of light are demonstrated in a H2-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber using the device.
