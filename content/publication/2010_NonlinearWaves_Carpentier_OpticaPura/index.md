abstract: In this paper we analyse various applications of nonlinear waves governed by nonlinear Schrödinger equations. We look at three types of systems, namely ultracold atomic gases (Bose-Einstein condensates) periodic photonic structures and optical media with high-order nonlinearities. Results are presented as relevant applications ranging from the design of atomic lasers to new quantum phase transitions in optical systems
