abstract: Many fields such as biospectroscopy and photochemistry often require sources of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) pulses featuring a narrow line width and tunable over a wide frequency range. However, the majority of available VUV light sources do not simultaneously fulfill those two requirements and few if any are truly compact, cost-effective, and easy to use by nonspecialists. Here we introduce a novel approach that goes a long way to meeting this challenge. It is based on hydrogen-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber pumped simultaneously by two spectrally distant pulses. Stimulated Raman scattering enables the generation of coherence waves of collective molecular motion in the gas, which together with careful dispersion engineering and control over the modal content of the pump light, facilitates cooperation between the two separate Raman combs, resulting in a spectrum that reaches deep into the VUV. Using this system, we demonstrate the generation of a dual Raman comb of narrowband lines extending down to 141 nm using only 100 mW of input power delivered by a commercial solid-state laser. The approach may enable access to tunable VUV light to any laboratory and therefore boost progress in many research areas across multiple disciplines
