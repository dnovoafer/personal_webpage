abstract: We show that, by tuning interactions in nonintegrable vector nonlinear Schrödinger equations modeling Bose-Einstein condensates and other relevant physical systems, it is possible to achieve a regime of elastic particlelike collisions between solitons. This would allow one to construct a Newton’s cradle with solitons and supersolitons, localized collective excitations in solitary-wave chains
